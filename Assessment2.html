<h1>Mo Salah scores spectacular goal in front of packed Anfield</h1>

<p>Liverpool played out a dramatic 2-2 with Manchester City. Mo Salah's goal on 76 minute will go down as one of the all time greats in Premier League goals history. Tensions were high on the touchline once again as Klopp faced his old rival Pep Guardiola once again.
<h2>Here is what Pep Guardiola had to say about the draw</h2>
<p>"It was end to end. I am proud of my players. We fought until the final whistle. What a game for the neaturals! However, I can't understand why the referee didn't send Milner off for a second yellow card. I am completely puzzled by it"</p>
